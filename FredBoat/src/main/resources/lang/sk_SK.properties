volumeApology=Sorry\! The volume command is not available for use on the public Fredboat. Adjusting the audio volume heavily increases CPU load which is too expensive a feature to be supported on a wildly popular music bot. You can turn the volume down by right clicking (or tapping for mobile users) on it in the voice channel and using the slider. If you'd like to have a volume command and some extra awesome features, check out how to become a Patron and gain access to an exclusive bot here\:
